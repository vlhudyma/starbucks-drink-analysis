# Starbucks Drinks Analysis

## About this project
This is my first small data project. I used a public dataset with Starbucks drinks.  
I wanted to see which categories have the most sugar, calories, and caffeine.  
I also checked if the most high-calorie drink is the same as the one with the most caffeine.  
I looked at sugar levels in each category and built a simple graph.

## Tools I used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## What I did
- Imported the data and added libraries
- Cleaned the data: removed empty values, fixed column names and data types
- Found the drink with the most calories and the most caffeine
- Compared these two drinks
- Calculated average sugar per drink category
- Found top 5 drinks with the most sugar
- Built a bar chart to show average sugar by category
- Wrote a few key insights at the end

## Key findings
1. Frappuccino drinks have the most sugar (more than 57 g on average).
2. Coffee drinks have almost no sugar.
3. Smoothies look healthy, but have a lot of sugar.
4. The most high-calorie drink is not the one with the most caffeine.
5. Average sugar in categories goes from 0 to 57 g.

## What I learned
This was my first real project, and it was very important for me.  
I wrote many things for the first time and now I understand how it works better.  
Practice helped me much more than just watching courses.  
I also worked with graphs for the first time, which was new and interesting.  
Overall, I really enjoyed working with data and doing simple analysis.
